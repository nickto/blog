## Multiprocessing in Python

Although Python is not very well suited for parallel programming, sometimes it
could be useful.

If it’s a computation, then we are probably better off using something like
[Dask](https://dask.org/), [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), etc. But if it’s
not computations, then there is a built-in solution in Python:
[multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html).

We’ll stick with computations for examples though, since their are simpler.

### Comparison of parallel and not parallel

A quick illustration of why parallelization is great when the problem is
embarrassingly parallel.

#### Not parallel

{{< highlight python "linenos=inline" >}}
import time

def square(x):
    time.sleep(1)
    return pow(x, 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    started_at = time.time()

    xs = range(10)
    results = [square(x) for x in xs]
    print(results)
    
    finished_at = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {(finished_at - started_at):f}")
{{< / highlight >}}

Output: 

```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
Elapsed: 10.007492
```

#### Parallel

{{< highlight python "linenos=inline" >}}
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool

def square(x):
    time.sleep(1)
    return pow(x, 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    started_at = time.time()
    xs = range(10)

    with Pool(5) as p:
        results = p.map(square, xs)
    print(results)
    
    finished_at = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {(finished_at - started_at):f}")
{{< / highlight >}}

Output: 

```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
Elapsed: 2.180675
```

## Limitations of multiprocessing

If it’s a simple case, like the one above, everything works fine. However,
multiprocessing relies on pickle, which requires[^1] that

> […] picklable functions and classes must be defined in the top level of a
> module.

This makes parallelizing functions that were created dynamically impossible. For
example, the following code will not run:

{{< highlight python "linenos=inline" >}}
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool

def power_factory(y):
    def f(x):
        time.sleep(1)
        return pow(x, y)
    return f

if __name__ == '__main__':
    started_at = time.time()
    
    square = power_factory(2)
    xs = range(10)
    with Pool(5) as p:
        results = p.map(square, xs)
    print(results)
    
    finished_at = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {(finished_at - started_at):f}")
{{< / highlight >}}

It throws the following exception:

```
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'power_factory.<locals>.f'
```

## Overcoming limitations

One way of solving the issue would be to rewrite code in a way that does not
require dynamic functions. The simple example above could be rewritten using
`apply_async` or `starmap`, for instance.

### `apply_async`

{{< highlight python "linenos=inline" >}}
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool

def slow_pow(x, y):
    time.sleep(1)
    return pow(x, y)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    started_at = time.time()
    
    xs = range(10)
    results = []
    with Pool(5) as p:
        for x in xs:
            results.append(p.apply_async(slow_pow, (x, 2)))
        results = [r.get() for r in results]
    print(results)
    
    finished_at = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {(finished_at - started_at):f}")  
{{< / highlight >}}

Output:

```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
Elapsed: 2.039259
```

### `starmap`

{{< highlight python "linenos=inline" "linenos=inline">}}
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool

def slow_pow(x, y):
    time.sleep(1)
    return pow(x, y)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    started_at = time.time()
    
    xs = range(10)
    with Pool(5) as p:
        results = p.starmap(slow_pow, zip(xs, [2]*len(xs)))
    print(results)
    
    finished_at = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {(finished_at - started_at):f}") 
{{< / highlight >}}

Output:

```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
Elapsed: 2.026638
```

### Pathos

However, if we cannot rewrite the code,
[Pathos](https://pathos.readthedocs.io/) package has a solution. Among other
things, aiming at making parallel computing easier, it has "better
multiprocessing and multi-threading in Python"[^2] in the multiprocessing module.
The same code as above could be implemented using pathos with minimal changes in
the following way:

{{< highlight python "linenos=inline" >}}
import time
from pathos.multiprocessing import ProcessPool  # different import

def power_factory(y):
    def f(x):
        time.sleep(1)
        return pow(x, y)
    return f

if __name__ == '__main__':
    started_at = time.time()
    
    square = power_factory(2)
    xs = range(10)
    with ProcessPool(5) as p:  # different name for Pool
        results = p.map(square, xs)
    print(results)
    
    finished_at = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {(finished_at - started_at):f}")
{{< / highlight >}}

Output:

```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
Elapsed: 2.019734
```
